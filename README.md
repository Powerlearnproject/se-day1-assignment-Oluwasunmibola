Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the application of engineering principles, methods, tools to the development and maintenance of software systems.
Software engineering is important as it entails the entire lifecycle of developing applications from designing all the way to maintainance.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The development of programming languages - This involved the creation of languages that was used in building applications.
The rise in agile methodologies - this was in the year 2000s
The esablishment of software engineering as a discipline - this was around the 1950s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
- Requirements 
- Design
- Implementation
- Testing
- Deployment
- Maintenance

The requirement phase involves gathering information about what user needs and system required.
The design phase involves providing a detailed design of the software application and system architecture.
The implementation phase involves using a programming language to developed the designed application.
The testing involves conducting various tests to ensure that the developed application meets the standard.
The deployment phase involves making the developed application available to users for consumption.
The maintance phase involves providing support, updates etc.
  

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology follows a linear and sequential approach where the project is divided into phases like requirement, design, implementation, testing,
deployment, maintainance. In this methodology, each phase is completed before another commences. while Agile methodology follows an iterative and incremental approach
allowing for flexiility, collaboration etc

The waterfall methodology can be used in scenerios where the oroject is small and there is clear understanding of the requirements of the project. while
The Agile methodology is usefulon large scale projects where the requirements of the project is likely to experience changes from time to time.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A software developer is responsible for writing codes to develop the software application, A quality assurance engineer is responsible for testing provided software to ensure it is up to standard
and of good design quality, A project manager oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated development environments (IDEs) are used to write codes to develop, test, and debug code for building software software and the version control systems are used to trach changes in software code 
and helps an corrdinating work within teams. Examples of IDEs include visual studio code, sublime text. Example of version control is git, bitbucket.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
- changing requirements
- Tight deadlines
- Technical debt

STrategies for overcoming these challanges includes: effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing involves testing individual components of the software.
Interaction testing involves testing interractions between componenets or subsystems.
System testing involves testing the entires system as a whole.
Acceptance testing involves testing the system against user requirements.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering refers to the text used to query Large Lnguage Models(LLMs) in order to get a desired response.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Whta is a prompt? - this question is vague and large as the word prompt can be used in different cases but when we say 
what is a prompt in prompt engineering? - then we are specific of the usecase of the definition of a prompt that we want.
